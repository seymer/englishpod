This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many, a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world. In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured. Due to to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the US Midwest, causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mike:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Moving to to Latin American,  Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming, but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country. In Chile, a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region. Losses are reported to be in the billions. Authorities have not yet released an official  statement. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Bob:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Not a great week for the world! Any good news? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mike:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I'm afraid not, Bob. One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region.
