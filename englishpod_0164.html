I failed you. Although I did not lie to you in words, I lied to you with faces that did not belong to me. I never meant to ruin the friendship that meant the world to me. You mean the world to me and now I come to you asking for forgiveness. If in your heart you find you can't, then I will understand and learn from this experience.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most. We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually feel something other than hurt. You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence where there was doubt, a shoulder where tears could fall and completeness where there was emptiness. I wanted to hold onto to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice. What I didn't realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all that I had placed in you.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk. I wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to handle. I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed impossible. I wanted to love you in only the way you deserved to be loved, never realizing that I was destroying myself and you. Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life. The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true. Nothing else mattered to me except hearing the laughter in your voice when you were happy. You made my days easy to get through and my nights peaceful; you helped me look forward to another day. Even though distance separated us, just being was enough.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I'm sorry for hurting you and if I had to do all over again I would have been 100% with you.  Forgive me please,</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0164">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2009 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
