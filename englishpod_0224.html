We’re glad to see you! We could sure use your expertise on this one. It’s a break-in, but nothing seems to have been stolen. We received a call from the Bear family at around ten thirty this morning. They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess! Broken chairs and porridge all over the place! Apparently, Momma Bear had made the porridge a little too hot, you see, and they were waiting for it to cool down. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Detective MeGee:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Okay then, let’s start examining the evidence…. Have the forensics team been in yet? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>McGraw:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yes sir. They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak. Hopefully, they will be able to identify the burglar soon. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Detective MeGee:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Hmmmm,Ah ha! What’s this? A strand of golden hair…… this is a very important piece of trace evidence McGraw. It tells me the suspect has long golden hair……. very few men have long golden hair……. our criminal could be a woman…… </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>McGraw:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>A woman? Was she working alone? Did she have an accomplice? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Detective MeGee:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>An accomplice? No, no McGraw, she was definitely working alone. See here, there are footprints in the porridge, here on the floor…. footprints,  tells me that our suspect is small…. could possibly be a child. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>McGraw:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>A child? Surely not, sir… </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Detective MeGee:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>We must follow the clues, McGraw! The evidence doesn’t lie! Now, let’s reconstruct the crime…… the suspect came in, sat in each chair breaking the smallest one into little pieces. Next, the porridge. she obviously tried to eat it and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor…. this mess. interesting. These footprints seem to lead upstairs. McGraw, did your officers clear the scene? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>McGraw:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, there was no one down here… and maybe we forget to check upstairs. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Goldylocks:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Hey! What’s with all the noise? I’m trying to sleep up here! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Detective MeGee:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>There she is! Get her! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">forensics</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">scientific tests used in the investigation of crime</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">identify</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">discover and define</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">strand</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a single length of</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">accomplice</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a person who helps another in committing a crime</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">reconstruct</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">form a picture of a crime by piecing together evidence</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">Give it to me straight</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">tell me something directly and honestly</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">suspect</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">think something is false</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">yellow tape</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">A tape used by police to block off a crime scene</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Crime Scene Investigator</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">The person in charge of collecting evidence</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Trespasser</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">A person who illegally enters private property</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Destruction of property</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">The physical damage of private property</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0224">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
