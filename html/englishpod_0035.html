I    thought   you  were pleased with  his  overall   performance.  Didn't    you  just   tell  me  last   week   how   impressed  you  were    with   his  attitude?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yeah,    his  attitude  is   great,    but    he's  really   unreliable.    Sometimes  he's    really   productive,    but   then  other  times... take  last   Tuesday   for instance,      he   was  forty-five   minutes   late   for   our  morning meeting!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well,    I'm  sure  he  had a  perfectly good  reason...</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>But   that's   not  the  only  thing...  you  know,    he  really  doesn't   have  the  best  work ethic,   I'm   constantly   catching  him  on  MSN   and  Facebook  when  he   should  be talking    to  clients.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yeah,   but  come on,    Geoff,    as if you   don't  check  Facebook at   work.    Look,     you   hired  this  guy,    we've  invested    a lot   of   time  and  money   in  his  training,   so  now  it's up to you to coach  him.
