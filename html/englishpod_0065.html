Now,   I have a couple of final questions.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I hope they're not too hard!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, why should we hire you?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.  I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team  solved about  seventy percent of our customers' problems.  I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers' issues.  Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time efficiently.  I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how   to get organized  and use my time efficiently, so I think I'm getting better now.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Great...  Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview. We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Great,   thanks a lot! I hope to hear from you! Good bye.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">a perfect fit</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">the right person for the job</td></tr><tr><td width="100">acumen</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the ability to think clearly and make good decisions</td></tr><tr><td width="100">excel</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">be superior to, among the best</td></tr><tr><td width="100">head</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">to be the leader of something</td></tr><tr><td width="100">implement</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">to make something active or effective</td></tr><tr><td width="100">training session</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">a meeting where people acquire skills and knowledge about a subject</td></tr><tr><td width="100">struggle</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">have a difficult time</td></tr><tr><td width="100">punctuality</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">arriving or doing something at the expected or planned time</td></tr><tr><td width="100">address</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">to deal with (a matter, issue, problem, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td width="100">short list</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">to select a few candidates in order to make a final selection or decision</td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">prospect</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">someone or something that is likely to succeed or to be chosen</td></tr><tr><td width="100">CV</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">curriculum vitae; a short document that describes your education, work experience, etc.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">shortcoming</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a weakness that someone has</td></tr><tr><td width="100">asset</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a valuable or beneficial thing or ability that a person has</td></tr><tr><td width="100">triumph</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a great success or achievement a person has/ triumph</td></tr></table></body></html>
