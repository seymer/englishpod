I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession. I wanted to re-emphasize our corporate mission  of Aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Several other shops have reduced the prices for their coffees and are drawing in more customers. Why aren’t we doing the same thing?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to  the level of our competitors. We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term sales. If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Customers don’t care about the coffee anymore. They only care about the price. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I disagree. Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places. Our coffee bean  are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees. When you compare the coffees side-by-side our coffee wins the taste test every time. We have never sought to appeal to the mass market  with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to the best best tasting  brews and it’s important to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I think the main question is how we can show our appreciation to our customers.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That’s the main question I would like to discuss today. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Money is tight for everyone these days so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee. Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies  why don’t we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do some research. The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started selling coffee beans. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">devalue</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">reduce in value</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">discerning</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">Showing insight and understanding</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">state-of-the-art</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the latest and most advanced in technology</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">awareness</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">showing realization and perception</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">undermine</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to subvert or weaken insidiously or secretly</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">Product Placement</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">also called "embedded marketing", where a company's products are placed in strategic places in film, television, or other forms of media</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Downturn</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a recession ; when things are not going very well</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Value Proposition</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">an analysis of the total cost and benefits of a product that a company can deliver its customers</td></tr><tr><td width="100">R&D</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">Research and development</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Excel</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">to be very good at doing something, to do something better than anyone else</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Lifestyle Segmentation</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">when the population is divided up into different categories based upon hobbies, interests, spending habits, etc.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Word of Mouth</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">advertisement that is spread through positive reviews from consumers, instead of from print or TV commercials</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0269">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
