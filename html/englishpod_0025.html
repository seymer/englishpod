And it's come to my attention  that our company lacks any sort of   bird flu  c</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Basically, we need to come up with   a clear plan; we need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic  strikes.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>So, what I’d  like to do   is: first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan; Ralph, I’d like you to head up  this project.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Sure, no problem.    What issues do you want me to consider?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, let’s see,    there are  a few    points    we need  to be thinking  about...    first, I’ll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak might have.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You’ll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected; think of ways to reduce  employee-customer contact,   perhaps some IT solutions  that will allow  our people to work from home.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I guess you’ll need me to forecast  employee absences as well,   right?  And I’ll think about the impact this will have  on our clients.  Hey, what about vaccines?  Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Exactly right. So, I’ll leave this to you,   and we’ll review the draft plan in two weeks.  Okay, so, anyone want to order  some KFC for lunch?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">order of business</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">an issue that must be discussed</td></tr><tr><td width="100">bird flu</td><td width="100">common noun, non-variable</td><td width="100">flu originated from birds that carry virus</td></tr><tr><td width="100">contingency plan</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">a plan that prepares for a situation where things can go wrong</td></tr><tr><td width="100">critical</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">extremely important</td></tr><tr><td width="100">pandemic</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a situation where a disease is spread out very quickly, and affects many people in many countries</td></tr><tr><td width="100">draft</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">make a first version of something</td></tr><tr><td width="100">impact</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">major influence or effect on something</td></tr><tr><td width="100">outbreak</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a sudden start of disease affecting many people</td></tr><tr><td width="100">head up</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">lead and be responsible for</td></tr><tr><td width="100">forecast</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">predict what is going to happen based on available information</td></tr><tr><td width="100">vaccine</td><td width="100">common noun, plural</td><td width="100">medical substance that protect people or animal against diseases</td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">epidemic</td><td width="100"></td><td width="100">event where a disease spreads really quickly and affects a large number of people</td></tr><tr><td width="100">backup plan</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">a plan made in case events go badly</td></tr><tr><td width="100">pandemic preparedness plan</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">a plan to prepare for the possible outbreak of a pandemic</td></tr><tr><td width="100">transmit disease</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">pass disease from one individual to another</td></tr><tr><td width="100">avian influenza</td><td width="100"></td><td width="100">bird flu</td></tr><tr><td width="100">influenza</td><td width="100">common noun, non-variable</td><td width="100">flu; illness caused by a virus</td></tr></table></body></html>
