Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I am sure that some of the things that we will be talking about today may surprise you. Billy can you turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok, does anyone know what this is? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Looks like a goat head to me! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Nice try, but this is a woman’s womb which contains her uterus and ovaries. The ovaries. are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day 1 as the first day of your last period. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That's amazing! So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Actually, every woman is already born with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some will start dying off immediately and others released during her fertile period. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>What about the guys? I know they produce sperm and stuff. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That’s right! The man’s body has a tiny factory that produces sperm twenty four hours a day! Each ejaculation will release about a hundred million sperm  so the factory is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>So, then we basically need to put one-and-one together so we can have babies right? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yes, the man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen. Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>And then? That's it? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any other questions? Then let's move on. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">womb</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the uterus of the human female</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">ovulation</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the discharge of a mature ovum from the ovary</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">ejaculation</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the discharge of semen by the male reproductive organs</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">embryo</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">in humans, the young in the early stages of development within the womb</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">wall</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the outermost layer defining the physical limits of an object</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">urethra</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">the part of the male anatomy which transports semen</td></tr><tr><td width="100">vas deferens</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">the specific tube which semen travel through</td></tr><tr><td width="100">scrotum</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a pouch with holds the testes</td></tr><tr><td width="100">pre menstrual syndrome</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a disorder during a woman's menstrual cycle characterized by depression and stomach cramps</td></tr><tr><td width="100">vagina</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">the female reproductive organ</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0255">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
