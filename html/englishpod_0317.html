Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Susan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Emily:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, this is my first paycheck here inthe States and there are a few things I don’t understand. First off, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Susan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>OK, let’s start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Emily:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yes, that’s easy enough to understand. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Susan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It’s your federal income tax. And then there’s Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Emily:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>All right, I see. So the Medicare isn’t actually a health insurance I can use now.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Susan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That’s right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There’s the state income tax, and then this SUI SDItax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it’s a pretty small quantity that they take.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Emily:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yeah, I don’t mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes – one at a state level and one at a federal level?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Susan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That’s right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Emily:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Susan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody’s net pay is as high as they’d like. I can understand why you’d want some explanation.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Emily:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yeah, I guess it’s the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h2>Key Vocabulary</h2><table><tr><td width="100">stub</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">for keeping a record of the content of the part filled out and torn away.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">federal</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">of or relating to a form of government or a country in which power is divided between one central and several regional governments</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">income</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">amount of money that you receive</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">fund</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a sum of money or other resources whose principal or interest is set aside for a specific objective</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">self-explanatory</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">needing no explanation,obvious</span></td></tr></table><h2>Supplementary Vocabulary</h2><table><tr><td width="100">basic</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">elementary or simple</td></tr><tr><td width="100">jargon</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">language peculiar to a particular trade, profession, or group</td></tr><tr><td width="100">welfare</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">financial or other assistance to an individual or family from a city, state, or national government</td></tr><tr><td width="100">deposit</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">to place for safekeeping or in trust</td></tr><tr><td width="100">tax</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0317">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
