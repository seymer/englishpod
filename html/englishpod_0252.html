What exactly is sexual education? Are you going to teach us like Kama sutra stuff like that? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>No Jason, that's not exactly what sex ed is. Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male and female bodies work. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>My older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.  I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Good point Jason! This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.  The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STD's from an infected person. Another popular method is using condoms. This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from STD's. Yes Jason? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>What are condoms made out of? How exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called Latex. As for your other question, that's a whole new class. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h2>Key Vocabulary</h2><table><tr><td width="100">curriculum</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the aggregate of courses of study given in a school, college, university, etc.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">contraceptive</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">device, drug, or chemical agent that prevents conception</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">condom</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a thin sheath worn over the penis during sex</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">to prevent</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to stop from happening</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">to contract</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to get or acquire, as by exposure to something contagious</span></td></tr></table><h2>Supplementary Vocabulary</h2><table><tr><td width="100">72 hour pill</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a pill taken immediately or within 72 hours of having unprotected sex</td></tr><tr><td width="100">abortion</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">the termination of a pregnancy</td></tr><tr><td width="100">planned parenthood</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a clinic in America which deals with sexually active adults</td></tr><tr><td width="100">syphillis</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">one form of a sexually transmitted disease</td></tr><tr><td width="100">penicillum</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">an anti-biotic used to treat syphillis</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="#englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0252">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
