You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Ugh... So how long is this going to take? An hour?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I'm afraid a bit more than that.  We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again. You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>What! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping?
