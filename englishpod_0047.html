As   I'm   sure   you're  all  aware,    with   the   credit crunch,   and  the  global financial crisis,   we're   obligated   to look  for   more cost efficient  ways  of   producing   our    goods.    We   don't   want  to have  to be  looking  at  redundancies.   So,    we've   outlined   a  brief   plan   to implement  the   just-in-time  philosophy.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>We   have two   basic   points   that  we want   to focus on.    First of all,   we  want  to reduce  our    lead time.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Why  would  want   to do  that?   I  think   this  is  not   an  area  that  really  needs  to be   worked on.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well,   we  want  to reduce   production and  delivery lead timesfor  better  overall  efficiency.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I see… That makes sense.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I'm with you on this one.  It’s essential that we reduce these errors; we've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Exactly.  Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.
