Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let's get started ! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Let's start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients ! Of course, each person's palate is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.  I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and  light. The best choices here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can't go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.  We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">to undervalue</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to put too low a value on</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">refreshing</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to provide new vigor and energy by rest, food, etc.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">a touch</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a slight quantity or degree</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">subtle</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">so slight as to be difficult to detect or describe</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">manageable</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">that can be managed or controlled</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">panini</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">originally an italian style sandwich made with a small loaf of bread</td></tr><tr><td width="100">deli</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a store where you can buy sandwich meats and bread</td></tr><tr><td width="100">cooking show</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a show which teaches people how to cook</td></tr><tr><td width="100">wheat bread</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a dark brown bread considered to be healthier to eat</td></tr><tr><td width="100">pickles</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a cucumber which has been fermented in a vinegar solution</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0249">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
